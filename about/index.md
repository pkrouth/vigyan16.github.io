[Prahlad K. Routh](http://www.prahlad.xyz) is a Materials Scientist and currently working as a Research Assistant at [Center for Functional Nanomaterials](http://www.bnl.gov/cfn/), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). He received his PhD from Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY in May 2016 and also received Masters in Science from Stony Brook University in May 2013. Prior to his PhD journey, Prahlad was awarded degree of Bachelors in Technology from Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India in 2009 followed by working as a Senior Research Fellow at IIT Madras for a year on high-temperature ceramics for thermal barrier coatings.

His interest in microscopy, led him to pursue research on structure-property characterization of energy harvesting materials using advanced optical characterizations tools. During his PhD research, Prahlad developed novel, low-cost micro-patterning techniques for conjugated polymers, which was highlighted on the [cover page](http://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201570244) of **October 7, 2015**  issue of [Advanced Functional Materials](http://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201502463) journal. He also worked on patterning of the solution processing of polymer hybrids with up-conversion nanoparticles & semiconducting nanocrystals and examined the interfacial interactions between them. 

He used time-resolved single molecule spectroscopy techniques, to study the light-matter interactions in energy harvesting materials at single nanocrystal level. Recently his work on interactions between 2D materials and quantum dots in order to overcome the challenges by creating a hybrid was published in prestigious journal of [ACS Nano](http://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.6b01538) and highlighted by various [media](https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=11829). 

In future, Prahlad expects to contribute further  towards solving challenges in energy harvesting, energy storage and designing next generation of nano-engineered electronic devices. Understanding  the light-matter interactions and controlling the exciton dynamics of novel nano-structured electronic materials such as emerging 2-D materials and perovskites nanoparticles is crucial for energy harvesting, photon detection and molecular sensing applications.
