[Prahlad K. Routh](http://www.prahlad.xyz) is a Materials Scientist and currently working as a Research Assistant at [Center for Functional Nanomaterials](http://www.bnl.gov/cfn/), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). In that role he investigates structural, optical and electronic properties of semiconducting hybrid materials. Specifically, he examines the ultrafast dynamics (pico-seconds to nano-seconds) of photoinduced interfacial interactions between organic and inorganic nanomaterials with sensitivity down to single particle level. 

Dr. Routh’s interest in microscopy, led him to pursue research on structure-property characterization of energy harvesting materials using advanced optical characterizations tools. During his Ph.D. research, he developed novel, low-cost micro-patterning techniques for conjugated polymers, which was highlighted on the [cover page](http://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201570244) of October 7, 2015 issue of [Advanced Functional Materials](http://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201502463) journal. His work highlighting improved properties of 0D-2D hybrids and the interactions between 2D materials and quantum dots, was published in [ACS Nano](http://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.6b01538) and was featured at Department of Energy, [BNL](https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=11829) and [SBU websites](http://www.stonybrook.edu/happenings/research/sbu-grad-students-help-pioneer-new-approach-for-improving-solar-cells/).

Dr. Routh plans to utilize his expertise in solution processing, patterning and time-resolved spectroscopy to contribute towards solving challenges in energy harvesting, energy storage and designing next generation of nano-engineered electronic devices. He is very interested in understanding the light-matter interactions and controlling the exciton dynamics of novel nano-structured electronic materials.  His immediate interests include, emerging 2-D materials and perovskite nanoparticles, crucial for energy harvesting, photon detection and molecular sensing applications.


Routh’s academic and professional careers have blended cutting edge science and science outreach over the last 10 years. He has been actively involved in STEM mentoring and science communication with New York Academy of Sciences initiatives such as Global STEM Alliance as well as with Brookhaven National Lab.


###### Prahlad Kumar Routh received an ‘Award of Honor’ in recognition of his outstanding achievement and dedication in pursuit of his Ph.D. from MSE Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY as well as Brookhaven National Laboratory in May 2016. He also received a Master’s in Materials Science and Engineering from SBU in 2013. Prior to coming to the United States, Prahlad earned his B. Tech. in Metallurgical and Materials Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Chennai, India in 2009.
