Layered metal dichalcogenides (LMDs) are emerging 2D semiconductors for energy harvesting, chemical sensing and photon detection applications due to their tunable band gap with thickness, high surface-to-volume ratio and strong light-matter interactions but exhibit poor light absorption properties. On the other hand, Colloidal Quantum dots exhibit size dependent band gap properties, and high absorption cross-section over a broad light spectrum. 

A novel 0D-2D hybrid materials combining SnS2 layers with CdSe/ZnS Qunatum Dots, can overcome the drawbacks of each materials and significantly improve system's photon absorption capability along with  enhanced charge mobilities. Using single crystal timeâ€”resolved spectroscopy, we demonstrated that interactions between SnS2 layers are driven by Energy Transfer, as opposed to charge transfer which is associated with change on ON-times and OFF-times probability distributions.
